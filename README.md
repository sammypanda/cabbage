<!-- OLD POINTS:
- Add a command /cabbage chest that spawns a chest somewhere like how chests would spawn at the start of a game
- Right clicking doesn't open the spawned chest and tells an expiry date (could use locked chest)
- Locked chest only opens when chest is expired
- [optional] Add effect for when chest is expired (open chest or similar)
- Add random number (under 30) of cabbage slices to expired chests
- Chest should disappear when cabbage taken
- Freeze all players who did not take that cabbage for 3 seconds
