## Project Outline
- ~~Create working file layout for minecraft plugins~~
- Add a command /chest that spawns a chest
- Right clicking doesn't open the spawned chest and tells an expiry date (could use locked chest)
- Locked chest only opens when chest is expired
- [optional] Add effect for when chest is expired (open chest or similar)
- Create "cabbage slice" item using bonemeal as the base item
- Add random number (under 30) of cabbage slices to expired chests
- Chest should disappear when cabbage taken
- Freeze all players who did not take that cabbage for 3 seconds
- ...
