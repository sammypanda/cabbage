## Project Outline
- ~~Create working file layout for minecraft plugins~~
- Create a /cabbage join command that allows you to choose a colour and remembers it
- Make the /cabbage join command classify a player into the team
- Create a /cabbage start command that teleports the joined users to a predefined location
- Create a /cabbage forcefinish command that forces a finish function and finishes a game
- Add a timer to the start command that counts up and stops when finished
- Add a command /cabbage chest that spawns a chest somewhere like how chests would spawn at the start of a game
- Right clicking doesn't open the spawned chest and tells an expiry date (could use locked chest)
- Locked chest only opens when chest is expired
- [optional] Add effect for when chest is expired (open chest or similar)
- Create "cabbage slice" item using bonemeal as the base item
- Add random number (under 30) of cabbage slices to expired chests
- Chest should disappear when cabbage taken
- Freeze all players who did not take that cabbage for 3 seconds
- ...
